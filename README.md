Offloading Techniques over Cloud

In this paper, we have summarized various techniques of how to combine the idea of offloading in android devices with cloud computing. 
The idea here is to partially upload computation from the mobile device for it to be processed remotely on the cloud. This reduces taxing 
the device resources and the illusion is seamless to the user as to where the computation is being carried out.
